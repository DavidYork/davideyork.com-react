The [7DRL (7 Day Roguelike Challenge)](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=7DRL) for 2016 has happened, and here is my entry!
It was a challenge to create this game in 7 days, but I'm quite proud of it.
Of course, I feel I've only scratched the surface of what the game could become with more time, effort and polish.

The premise is you are lost in outer space in an escape pod.
You get rescued, and to show your gratitude you offer to upgrade the ship's engines.

Only problem is, you don't know how to do that so everything explodes.
You have to get back to your escape pod before getting sucked out a hull breach or burnt alive!

Have fun trying not to get blown into outer space!
