While at college I founded (with my awesome friend [Mike Williams][mike] who now works at [Bungie][bungie]) the Computer Game Design Group which at its peak had around 30 members. During our first year we tried to make the __MOST AMBITIOUS GAME EVER ™__ which resulted in a whole lot of talking about the __MOST AMBITIOUS GAME EVER ™__ but not a lot of actually making the __MOST AMBITIOUS GAME EVER ™__. We learned from this experience so during the second year we split into 3 teams and created small simpler games. I worked with a team of four on a game called KumaX which is based on the old boardgame [Twixt][twixt]. It was implemented in DirectX and works with hotseat or over a network.
