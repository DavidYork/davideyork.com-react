I love [Unity][unity]!  One of my favorite aspects of Unity is my ability to work collaboratively with my Maya friends on creative projects.  This is one such example.  We were just screwing around in Unity for the hell of it.  I wrote the code, my friend created hundreds of assets and animations in a single weekend.  We made a 3D Rogue-like.  Highlights include:

* Multiple character classes
* Unlockable prestige classes
* Mad loot galore! Equippable to different equip targets (e.g. hands, head, body, finger, etc)
* Pretty standard RPG stats and progression
* Spells with areas of effects and complex behavior
* Randomly generated levels using several different generators
* Dynamic line of sight
