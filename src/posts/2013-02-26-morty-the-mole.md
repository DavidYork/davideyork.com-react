Commercially downloadable semi-casual puzzle game based loosely on Broderbundâ€™s amazing Boulderdash.  I removed the monsters and added lots more puzzle elements (keys and doors, breakable walls, moveable breakable vases, vines that can hold up moveable objects, etc).  I felt this made it more appropriate for a semi-casual audience (all the rage at the time) and played more to the strengths of the game.  I did the design, programming, and project management.  Art and music was commissioned and licensed.

Original fully playable prototype was written in Python, later a C++ port was created.  Currently it is not available for download as I am porting it to a Steam + iOS re-release.

Highlights include:

* 101 levels
* Multiple level themes (ice, desert, jungle, etc)
* Animated tiles, particle effects, sfx galore!
* Rewards for completing levels in a small number of moves
* Hundreds of unique tiles
