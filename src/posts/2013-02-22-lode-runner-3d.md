I used to play the amazing Broderbund game [Lode Runner][lode-runner] when I was a wee lad.  The best part – you could make your own levels using their level editor.  Endless hours of fun creating really entertaining platform puzzles.

During college for a programming class which covered, amongst other things, Win32 programming I developed a 3D Lode Runner game with my friend [Ryan Triplett][ryan].  Well, okay, it’s more of a 2.5D game.  Uses Win32, Windows GDI.
