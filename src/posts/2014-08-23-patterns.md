I was an engineer on [Patterns][patterns], a multi-player open sandbox building game game made by [Free Range Games][free-range-games] and [Linden Lab][linden-lab]. This was a project created with [Unity3D][unity3d] for Mac and Windows PCs.

[Patterns][patterns] is a large and ambitious project where users could build complex creations with dozens of different types of shapes. Players could add Lua scripts to their creations to create gamification mechanics and achieve high levels of customization.  Patterns is [available on Steam][steam].
