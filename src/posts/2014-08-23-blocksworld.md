I worked as a **full-stack iOS + backend engineer** on [Bocksworld][blocksworld], creative block-based building game for kids by [Linden Lab][linden-lab]. This was is created with C# in [Unity3D][unity3d], Objective-C, Ruby and MySQL.  I have contributed to all technical aspects of it's development.

[Blocksworld][blocksworld] has been enjoyed by millions of users who have created and shared **millions of creations**! Blocksworld is [available on the Apple app store][app-store].

Blocksworld is a free app with in-app purchases.
