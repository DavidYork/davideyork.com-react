[Download from the Apple App Store here!][app-store]

I have a tradition of teaching myself a new programming language or technology by writing yet-another-version of “Mindless Dungeon Crawl (MDC).”  This tradition started when I was procrastinating my grad school compilers homework.  I have written MDC in Python, JavaScript, C++, C# with WinForms, Objective-C with iOS, C++ &amp; Objective-C on iOS with Cocos2D, C# with MonoTouch and finally Unity3D which is the version you see here.  Each time it’s a different game with graphics (sometimes it’s a text game) and different mechanics but it never takes itself seriously.

This game was downloaded 800 times on its first day, was favorably reviewed by [Touch Arcade][touch-arcade] and gets a modest number of downloads daily.

Creature artwork was licensed from [Joe Calkins of Cerberus Art][cerberus].  Send him all your money, he earned it.  UI, backgrounds and fonts were me.
